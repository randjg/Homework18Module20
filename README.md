# Homework18Module20

For this homework assignment, I initialized four tests, consisting of two positive cases and two negative cases.

**Positive Cases:**
- Get All Data: Fetch all data and validate it against the JSON Schema.
- Create New User: Successfully create a new user.
  
**Negative Cases:**
- Invalid Endpoint: Attempt to get data using an invalid endpoint.
- Invalid Parameter: Attempt to get data with an invalid parameter.
  
All tests were successful, as shown in the image below.
